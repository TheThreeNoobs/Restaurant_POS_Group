# Group Project - *CrunchE*

**CrunchE** is an app that allows for users to take orders at restaurants, keep track of sales, and synchronizes real-time data between various users (staff, management, and the kitchen). 

**Management** - Has the capability to construct the menu by adding or deleting items. He can keep track of the overall sales of the restaurant by viewing how much of each item is sold and what is the overall best-selling item. 
**Staff** - Has the capaability to take orders by clicking on an item from the menu which will be added to the order of that particular table. 
**Chef** - Has the capability to delete items off of the Active Orders tab which then increments the revenue of each item in the sales tab. 

Time spent: **12** days spent in total

Notes: 
This is only the basic wireframe on the main components of the app. Our group will further expand on these areas as we go through developing this app because we will learn more of how we want to structure it as we go through the development process. This wireframe is mainly the initial groundwork we have laid out for our app, which we will build upon.

## Notes
CrunchE is designed to aid restaurant management in various facets of restaurant work. It is designed to make the process of ordering, managing staff and keeping track of sales a much easier process. A restaurant workforce has to deal with many issues in his day to day job, so our app is meant to make the work life easier for the manager and the rest of the staff in their daily work.
